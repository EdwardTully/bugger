# React Redux practice

built this from memory, for the most part.  Wanted to use a button to begin the data fetch. Discovered that in order to keep things independant, a slice must be made for each, ie you cant use one slice to be a source for independantly listing users emails phone numbers.  ALso, it seemed that it was best to create separate compenents to view each data type.
